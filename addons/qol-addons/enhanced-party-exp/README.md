// Give additional experience bonus per party-member involved on even-share parties (excluding yourself)?
// ex. If set to 10, an even-share party of 5 people will receive +40% exp (4 members * 10% exp):
//     140% party experience in total, so each member receives 140%/5 = 28% exp (instead of 20%).
